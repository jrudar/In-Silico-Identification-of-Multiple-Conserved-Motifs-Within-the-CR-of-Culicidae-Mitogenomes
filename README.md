# In-Silico-Identification-of-Multiple-Conserved-Motifs-Within-the-CR-of-Culicidae-Mitogenomes
Data for the manuscript titled "In-Silico Identification of Multiple Conserved Motifs Within the Control Region of Culicidae Mitogenomes"

The data to support our manuscript can be found in the 'Data' directory.
This directory consists of 4 files: The GenBank and FASTA records for each Culicidae and Non-Culicidae mitogenome

The classifier used to train our model can be found in the 'classifier' directory.
This directory contains a single Python script, 'clf.py', which contains the code for the model.
